grande.js
=========

This is a small Javascript library that implements features from Medium's editing experience. Take a look [here](http://mattduvall.com/grande.js/).

How to get started
------------------

### Installation
Bower is the preferred way to install `grande.js`, it is available as `grande` in the Bower package repository.

Simply `bower install grande`

### Usage

See the `index.html` in this repository for a functional example using the library.

To get up and running simply...

1. Include an `<article>` with `contenteditable`
2. Include the `grande.min.js` file (in `dist/` directory) at the bottom of your `<body>`
3. Bind the events on the `article` tags with `grande.bind(document.querySelectorAll("article"))`
4. You are set!

### Included files

There are two CSS files that come with the included demo:

- `editor.css`: this file provides the style for the `contenteditable` elements on the page
- `menu.css`: this file provides the toolbar styling to appear as it does below

## Options to grande.bind

The `bind` function currently accepts two parameters: bindableNodes and an options list.

The calling code can pass in a `NodeList` as the first parameter that will bind to these elements and enable `contentEditable` on them, if nothing is passed in it defaults to elements that match the selector `.g-body article`.

The second parameter is an `options` object that accepts the following keys:

- `placeholder`: if set, this will be the placeholder value of the element(s), when the user focus on the element the placeholder will be deleted and put back when blurred while the field is empty.

- `animate`: if true, this will trigger the CSS animations (defaults to true). Useful to turn to false if `subpixel-antialised` is needed in Safari.

The following tag stylings are available: `<b>`, `<i>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<blockquote>`, `<a>`, `<ol>`, `<ul>`, `<hr>`

Questions
---------
### This is very similar to Zenpen, why?
First off, major props to @tholman for the inspirational script. grande.js is a spiritual cousin of the fantastic plugin and aims to have feature parity with Medium. It adds multiple styles and will be diverging from the vision of being an in-browser editing experience to being a *provider* of the in-browser editing experience. grande.js will be providing the foundation for your website to have a wonderful editing experience.

Roadmap
-------
- Images (figure)
- execCommand to support `<strong>` and `<em>`
- CSS animations to match the `pop-upwards` on Medium
